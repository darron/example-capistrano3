Example Capistrano 3 configuration.
===================

Switching from Capistrano 3 seemed a little harder than it should have been.

I looked everywhere for some example code, but most of it didn't work or used Capistrano 2 syntax.

This repo is extracted from a final working set for a Rails app we deployed.

It uses:

1. Rails
2. Thin
3. nginx

YMMV - let me know if there's anything amiss.
